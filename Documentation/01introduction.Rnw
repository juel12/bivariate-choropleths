\section{Introduction}

This app was created using shiny \cite{Chang.2018} with R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20). Its purpose is to create bivariate choropleths. Creating bivariate choreopleths can be a bit tricky and somewhat time-consuming, especially for newbies in R and similar programs. Therefore, an app might be a convenient way to simplify the creation of bivariate choreopleths. \\
\hspace*{2em} The app was not specifically created for psychological purposes. However, data visualization and exploration are gaining importance for psychological research. The current app can be a helpful tool for exploring potential relationships between two variables across different geographical areas or may be used to visualize the findings of such. The app can be applied to any topic, including psychological questions, depending on the data. For example, a health psychologist may be interested in one of the many eurostat datasets concerned with health (e.g. self-perceived health).\\
\hspace*{2em} At this point, it has to be noted, that data exploration tools should never be used for fishing, which can severely bias results. Furthermore, data visualization can not in any way replace statistical testing of previously defined hypotheses.
