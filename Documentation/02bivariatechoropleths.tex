\section{Bivariate Choreopleths}

The bivariate choreopleths created in the app are being created following the instructions by \citeA{ArtSteinmetz.2017}. The variables compred in the plot are being normalized to avoid displaying population sizes \cite{JoshuaStevens.2015}. All bivariate choreopleths are produced using the packages tmap \cite{Tennekes.2018} and leaflet \cite{Cheng.2018}.
