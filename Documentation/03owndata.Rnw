\section{Own dataset}

The user can choose to upload a dataset. However, so far only excel datasets (.xls or .xlsx) can be uploaded. Moreover, the data need to be cleaned beforehand. The dataset should be given in wide format.\\
\hspace*{2em} After uploading a dataset, a table is rendered displaying the data. This may help the user to select different variables in the sidepanel. The user needs to select two variables that are of interest and a variable with the geographic areas (either German federal states or European countries). Optionally, a variable containing some kind of time information (e.g. years) can be specified (optional), in which case any level of the variable can be selected. Furthermore, the user needs to select the map that will be used to plot the data. So far, only maps of European countries and German federal states are available. Maps can not be uploaded by the user. The levels of the dataset variable containing the geographic area needs to correspond to the map.\\
\hspace*{2em} If a time variable and any level of the variable are selected, the dataset will be filtered based on the level of this variable (e.g. only data from the year 2015 will be used going forward). The variables that are compared in the bivariate choropleth will be normalized on the variable containing the population sizes for each area.\\
\hspace*{2em} After the "Create plot" button has been clicked, the bivariate choreopleth and a legend will be rendered. A mapshot of the bivariate choreopleth can be downloaded.
